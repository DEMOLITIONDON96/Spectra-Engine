</p>

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine Feather is currently in a Work in Progress stage, maintained by the main developers and contributors.

----------------------------------------------
**FOREVER ENGINE FEATHER REQUIRES THE LATEST FLIXEL LIBRARIES TO BE INSTALLED**.

**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRASHES / ISSUES WITH OLDER VERSIONS OF FLIXEL, NOR I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING SAID VERSIONS**.

----------------------------------------------
# Features:
* All of [Forever Engine Legacy](https://github.com/Yoshubs/Forever-Engine-Legacy)'s Features;
* A Scripting System based on HScript, [SScript](https://github.com/AltronMaxX/SScript);
* Reorganized ``source/`` folder;
* An [Events](/assets/events) System based on [Hypno's Lullaby](https://github.com/PopcornColonell/hypnosource);
* Fully Softcoded [Game Weeks](/assets/weeks) and [Characters](/assets/characters).
